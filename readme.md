# Guess That Song
*Guess That Song* is a time limited game where the objective is to guess the name of the artist and song given several lines of lyrics from that song. Players with high scores are recorded on a global leaderboard.

Each question gets scored depending on number of hints (lines of lyrics) revealed and number of incorrect guess attempts made. The less hints and less incorrect guess attempts made, the higher the score. The player gets a limited amount of time depending of the difficulty level selected in game settings. Once time is up, the player is given their score and a field for entering in their name.

The leaderboard can be viewed from the home screen.
